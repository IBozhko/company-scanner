# company-scanner
Easy console app, has basic exception handling, encapsulation

Company is a programm I used in university couple of years ago. In ver1 it stores data in basic array and allowes to perform some basic operations like add worker, calculate average wage in departments, etc. Has some basic exception handling, including couple of unchecked exceptions. I might do some changes to it, if I'll have some time after I finish my main project, bank-map.

Version 1 - data is stored in basic array (var[]), and allowes some really basic operations on this data, functionality is limited and it doesn't have any verification of data integrity.
